#Nonlinear propogation of Fiber


##Introduction
ToDo
 
1. Introduce the field. Why it is important? What is the context?  Where is it going? Is it still active?

1. Talk about non-linear behaviour in general. Show how
the chi term comes into play.

2.Talk briefly about the cause of dynamic changes in 
non-linear progogation (dispersion and self phase modulation), do your best to connect it to the lectures.

3. After mentioning them individually, talk about how these
things can interact to give very interesting phenomena, ie, solitons, filimentation.
 (Either find, or construct a figure to illustrate soliton propogation)
1 pg

##Non linear Schrodinger Equation

1. Derive it from Maxwell's equations in broad strokes 4 regimes.
2. Dispersion (talk about how the dispersion comes into being. I will want some figures to show how dispersion acts.
3. SPM. Talk about how SPM comes into play. Again, I will need some figures to illustrate this phenemena.

3. Split-Step Fourier method. Talk about why it is the best. Show some of the results of the simulations I've run.

4 pg

##Solitons
1. Discuss solitons in brief. History? What they are. Why they are important. Maybe mention why they are important in microresonators.
1. Show how the interaction of the SPM term and the Dispersion term can cancel each other out. (Show simulation results of solitons)
2 pg

##Other effects.
1. Other terms (laser foam takes into account Raman terms.
Show some simulations from Laser Foam.) 
2. Filimentation? 


##Conclusion
Sum up the results.
