!This program will take some input parameters
!and preform a split-step alogorithm to propogate
!an optical pulse through non-linear optical fiber.

!1. First, get back up to speed on fortran
!2. Then, test out the fourier transform program
!3. Inplement the alogorithm
!4. If time, put in the fancier adaptive methods 
!   used in the laser foam process. Anything that they
!   can do, I can do better.
