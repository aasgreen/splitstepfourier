Code, report and powerpoint for the split step fourier transform

#Outline

##Introduction
First, I am going to have the maxwell equations, and derive the Helmholtz equation very briefly.

Then I will *derive* the NLS equation, citing things heavily.

I will outline why the split-step method is best.

Then we will get into results.
